# Google Maps Snake Hack

This year Google has added an interactive snake game inside its Google Maps app for Android and IOS in celebration of April Fools’ Day. 
We wanted to play the game but got frustrated when we lost, so we thought – why not hack our way into winning!

So, we reversed engineered the app by using remote debugging and successfully achieved the task of never losing and even add some simple AI that will play the game for us.
